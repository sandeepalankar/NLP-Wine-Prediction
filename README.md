In this project, we investigated the problem of determining where a wine originated from based on several wine attributes including variety and price as well as user reviews on the taste of the wine. We chose this problem because we were motivated by our collective interest in wine tasting as well as wanting to study if wine descriptions and origination can be correlated.
We have two main contributions in this project, one data and one analysis. For the data contribution, we preprocess and encode the numerical data in a way that the natural language processing models can use and contextualize them with the text reviews. For the analysis contribution, we run several different machine learning models to handle this classification task to investigate the performance of various models as well as the sensitivity to a variety of hyperparameters.
Through this project, we have collected data, cleaned and processed it to serve as input to various machine learning models, and tuned the models to determine the optimal strategy to solve our problem. Based on our results, the BERT model resulted in the highest train, validation and test accuracies while the AdaBoost with decision tree model performed the best on the training set.
